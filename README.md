# Project 1: What did the presidents say at their inauguation?

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: How do presidents' reelection status and partisan relationship with their predecessor affect the sentiment of their inauguration speeches.
+ This project is conducted by [Bo Peng]

+ Project summary: From the president of a college hockey club to the president of the United States, leaders of all kinds customarily make their inauguration speeches about two thing: commenting on the past and promising the future. Hence it would be reasonable to speculate that the overall tone of a speech would be affected by whether the speaker is a first-time elect or a second-term president, as the part on the past would be more positive if the speaker was commenting on his own work in the office. Afterall, people tend to be more lenient on themselves, especially when they are politicians. Moreover, I suspect that the sentiment of an inauguration speech would be even more harsh if the speaker was not only a first-time elect, but also taking the office from a predecessor of the opposite party. In this project I attempt to approach these conjectures.
